# Hello, everyone! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Maarten Kloppenburg and this is my GitHub-account @mkloppenburg. Currently this GitHub is used for education and personal purposes. A lot of my repo's are hidden because of that, but you can view some of my work. My interests regarding IT are quite broad, currently I like fiddling around in some Python, C# or JavaScript/HTML. All while try to learn a bit more about some DevOps practices like CI/CD, YAML, containerization and so on. 

# Work ðŸ’¼
I'm currently enrolled in a IT traineeship with a focus on DevOps at Young Capital NEXT. I've finished a bootcamp there where I've done a project in C#, Python, HTML/CSS/JS. This project was deployed via GitHub to Azure (using Web-Apps and two different types of SQL Databases). It was a very nice learning experience that touched on a lot of aspects of the Software Development Life Cycle.
During the 2-month bootcamp I've passed the exams and am now certified for Agile Scrum, ISTQB and Azure on their foundation levels.

# Working on currently ðŸ’¡
Currently I'm working on expanding my knowledge of Azure, where my main focus currently is on the AZ-104/AZ-400 path. Of course I'll also keep on practicing my programming skills.
